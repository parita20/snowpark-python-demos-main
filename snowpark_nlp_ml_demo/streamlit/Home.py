#
# Medical Images are unstructured data types and snowflake allows you to vectorize these images by leveraging image reading libraries such as sci-kit image and openCV on snowpark using python. Tensorflow is also a supported library in snowpark and we can train machine learning models by pushing down the training workload to snowflake compute power to generate a model file. Thereafter using the trained tensorflow model file we can create a user defined function for inference that can detect Pneumonia by uploading a new X Ray image to get the probability of pneumonia. The streamlit library is used to build the app that works seamlessly with snowpark to perform the outlined steps to detect pneumonia.
